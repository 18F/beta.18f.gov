Prior to this repo, the team was keeping potential user stories in Trello. These are here now.

- As an 18F outreach team member I want a simple method for adding new team members to the site so that our content can be current and accurate.
- As an outreach team member, I want more analysis about blog posts so that I can make more informed editorial decisions.
- As a blog manager I want an easy way to connect related posts so that I can provide a better reading experience.
- As an 18F team member I want a homepage that represents the organization so that I can direct people to resources about our work, values, and team.
- As a potential partner agency, I want a website that easily surfaces 18F's work so that I can understand what it's like to work with 18F.
- As a potential partner agency I want resources about what the process for working wth 18F is so I know what to expect when working with 18F.
- As a potential 18F employee, I want to know what kinds of skills and work we do so that I can understand how to shape an application.
- As a member of the open source community I want a page that shows how 18F engages the community so that I can get involved.
- As a member of the open source community, I want to see a limited number of ways that I could immediately help 18F. (And I maybe want to see that as a module at the end of a blog post.)
- As a member of the public, I want to see a site map easily so that I can tell what kind of content is on the 18F site. (DOI has a nice one: https://www.doi.gov/)

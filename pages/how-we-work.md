We find our way through every project by putting the needs of the public
first. We use [human-centered design, agile methodologies, and open
source software](https://playbook.cio.gov/) to build world-class digital services for the American
public. We’re committed to working in the open, building accessible
products, and deploying early and often.

See exactly how we put all of those principles into practice by reading
through our guides on [accessibility](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/),
[CSS coding style](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/css-coding-styleguide/), [open source projects](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/), [content](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/), [lean product design](https://pages.18f.gov/lean-product-design/),
and [more](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/). We’re public about the standards we use, and we publish any
guidance we create for our staff.

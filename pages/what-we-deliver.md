## Custom products to solve your problems

If your agency’s project has a digital component, our team of software developers, visual designers, writers, and security experts can help you build it. We can help you:

- Improve a process for users, like we did with the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://my.uscis.gov/).
- Build a new site to showcase your data, like we did with Department of Education's [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/).
- Revamp your online presence — from data to branding and everything in between — like we did with the [Federal Election Commission](https://beta.fec.gov/).
- Scope a solution or workshop an idea, like we did with the [Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/09/how-a-two-day-spring-moved-an-agency-twenty-years-forward/).

## Innovative ways to buy technology

We believe federal IT acquisitions can be faster, cheaper, and produce
better results. If your agency is developing a new request for quotation
for IT services or is interested in innovative ways to buy technology,
our team is excited to work with you. We can help you:

- Write agile, modular, and user-centered design into your request for quotations through our RFP Ghostwriting service, like we did with the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/helping-california-buy-a-new-child-welfare-system/).
- Develop a marketplace to buy IT services using modern techniques, like we did with the [Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/).
- Buy small pieces of open source code to advance your projects, like we’re doing with our [micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/).

## Platforms built for government

Federal agencies face a unique set of technology problems. We’re
building a suite of secure, scalable tools and platforms that any agency
can use to solve these common problems. Our platforms are built with the
needs of government addressed right at the beginning and are being
actively improved to meet your needs. We can help you:

- Host your applications in the cloud with our [cloud.gov platform](https://cloud.gov/).
- Build customizable and easy-to-maintain static sites with the [Federalist platform](https://federalist.18f.gov/).
- Release and manage your API with [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/).

## A path to becoming a digitally-powered organization

We can embed a fully-dedicated 18F team within your agency to work
hand-in-hand with you to increase your internal digital capacity, help
you form new digital habits, and ultimately drive organizational culture change. We can help you:

- Attract, empower, and grow your own digital team.
- Adopt a DevOps culture and begin a transition to the cloud.
- Institute lean-agile practices, including agile acquisitions.
- Establish a model to modernize your legacy systems.

## Modern digital service techniques

We can provide your team with the skills and knowledge they need to
modernize your agency’s digital services. We’ve also built a number of
knowledge-sharing and documentation tools for 18F’s own use that you can
copy and use at your agency. We can help you:

- Run a workshop on agile software development, like the [Lego workshop we did with the Small Business Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/31/how-playing-with-legos-taught-executives-agile/) or the longer one we did with the [Social Security Administration](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/11/a-story-of-an-agile-workshop/).
- Host a design studio, like we did with the [Department of the Interior](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/25/design-studio-onrr/).
- Create your own lightweight knowledge sharing platform based off 18F’s [Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/) and [Pages](https://pages.18f.gov/) projects.

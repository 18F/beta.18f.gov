The CIO council came to the SF office to learn more about 18F in general and what we are doing in particular to help the government. Here are some of their questions and comments:

- What does 18F do? What kinds of things do we work on?
- What are 18F’s priorities?
- How did 18F get started?
- What is the difference between 18F and USDS?
- Can you give us this information on a physical legal-size engineering fold sheet of paper?
- How does 18F generate leads? 
- How can 18F help my agency?
- Do you have a website where we can see what kinds of things you’re working on? 
- How can we help 18F get more business?
- How can we see what you are working on at our agency? 
- How does 18F determine which projects to work on? Who in the partner agency itself decides which projects are the highest priority? (Does 18F talk to an agency’s CIO when deciding what to work on?)
- Who in the various government agencies is usually the one who contacts 18F?
- They were interested in the “Learn” division of 18F
- One thing the CIO of DHS was pleading for was an evangelist to come in to TSA (as a TSA employee--he felt this was really important) and convince them they could do new things. It seemed to me he feels the need for someone to come in and fight the agile/lean/user-centered fight on a daily basis.
